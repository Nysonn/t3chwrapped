      2. Workflow Preferences
      - Linear timeline vs. pattern-based
      - MIDI capabilities
      - Audio editing features
      
      3. Budget Considerations
      - Subscription vs. one-time purchase
      - Free trials available
      - Student discounts
      
      4. Hardware Compatibility
      - Available plugins
      - Controller integration
      - System requirements
      
      Remember, the best DAW is the one that feels most intuitive to you and helps you create music efficiently.`,
